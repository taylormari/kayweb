			<p>Kay Liang is a wonderful human being who hails from Toronto, Canada, and lives a playful life online as a creative education master where she develops worlds & stories alongside her students. She also is a multitalented socialite who graduated from Rhode Island School of Design in 2019 with a degree in printmaking, a poet and performer of the world, and an undying, enthusiastic explorer of media. </p>

			Ultimately, I can try to explain all her characteristics here, but she is simply someone you have to know, work with, or at least talk to. Her curiousity is infectious, so don't hesistate to reach out if you have any questions/ideas/proposals to ask her.</p>
